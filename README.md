# hot-mech
A tabeltop board game where two mechs face off for fast paced, card-in-hand gameplay. And, a set of python scrips to simulate and balance said game.

# TODO
* Rename character to pilot
* Dalle pictures of pilots
* Generate card printouts - flask/jninja?
* Try strength of 5x2 magnets?

* Simpily part counts, lower HP:
(can still print separately, but just glue in place - print little 'pucks' for perminient attachement - rather than magnets?)

thermo removable parts now:
per leg = 11 (22)
per arm = 4 (8)
torso = 7

total = 37

If we were to do '10' total:
Feet are 1 part
Torso is just face plate
Hips are joined

So:
Face = 1
Both Thighs = 2
Both Shins = 2
Both bicepts = 2
Both forearms = 2
(pilot?? = 1)

Total = 9 (10??)
